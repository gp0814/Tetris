Tetris Game Layout
-------------------

**Well:**
The well is a 12x23 grid of squares, with a gray border around the edges. Each square is 26 pixels wide and 26 pixels tall.

**Grid Coordinates:**
The grid is divided into squares, with the origin (0,0) at the top-left corner. The x-axis increases from left to right, and the y-axis increases from top to bottom.

**Color Scheme:**
- **Black:** Represents empty squares in the well.
- **Gray:** Represents the border around the well.
- **Color Array:** Each piece has a unique color from the array `tetraminoColors`. The colors are:
  - Cyan
  - Blue
  - Orange
  - Yellow
  - Green
  - Pink
  - Red

**Piece Layout:**
Each piece is represented by a set of points in the `Tetraminos` array. Each point is a pair of coordinates (x, y) that defines the position of the piece in the grid.

**Gameplay:**
- **Dropping Piece:** The current piece is represented by a set of points in the `Tetraminos` array. The piece is initially placed at the top of the well and falls down due to gravity.
- **Rotation:** The piece can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise using the arrow keys.
- **Movement:** The piece can be moved left or right using the arrow keys.
- **Dropping:** The piece can be dropped down one line using the space bar.
- **Fixing:** When the piece reaches the bottom of the well, it is fixed in place and becomes part of the well.
- **Clearing Rows:** When a row is completely filled with blocks, it is cleared and the pieces above it move down.
- **Scoring:** The score increases based on the number of rows cleared simultaneously.

**Score Display:**
The current score is displayed at the bottom of the screen in white text.

**Keyboard Controls:**
- **Up Arrow:** Rotate the piece clockwise.
- **Down Arrow:** Rotate the piece counterclockwise.
- **Left Arrow:** Move the piece left.
- **Right Arrow:** Move the piece right.
- **Space Bar:** Drop the piece down one line.

**Game Loop:**
The game runs in a continuous loop, with the piece falling down every second. The game ends when the piece reaches the top of the well and cannot be moved further.
